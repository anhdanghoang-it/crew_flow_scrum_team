    You are provided with raw client requirements for a software feature. The requirements are:
    <REQUIREMENTS>requirements</REQUIREMENTS>
    Transform raw client requirements into complete, production-ready user stories by:

    1. **Analyzing Requirements**: Extract core business value, identify user personas, and clarify ambiguous points
    2. **Writing User Stories**: Craft clear story statements in "As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]" format
    3. **Defining Acceptance Criteria**: Document testable Given-When-Then scenarios covering:
      - Happy path flows
      - Edge cases and boundary conditions
      - Error handling and validation
      - User feedback and messaging
    4. **Specifying UI/UX Requirements**: Detail interface components, interactions, layouts, and accessibility needs
    5. **Ensuring Story Readiness**: Verify each story meets Definition of Ready criteria for immediate development estimation and implementation
