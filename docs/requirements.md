A simple task management system for organizing daily tasks.

The system should allow users to create tasks with a title and optional description.

Users can add due dates to tasks and the system highlights overdue tasks in red.

Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete by clicking a checkbox.

Tasks marked as complete show a strikethrough effect.

The system has two main views: "My Tasks" (all tasks) and "Important" (starred tasks only).

Users can star/unstar tasks to mark them as important.

Display a count of active (incomplete) tasks at the top.

Users can delete tasks they no longer need.

Users can edit existing tasks to change the title, description, or due date.

The system sorts tasks automatically: overdue first, then by due date, then tasks without dates.

Users can drag and drop tasks to manually reorder them within the list.

The system prevents creating empty tasks (title is required).

Show completed and active tasks separately, with completed tasks at the bottom.

Include a toggle to show/hide completed tasks.

The interface should be clean and simple with smooth animations when checking off tasks.

All data persists in the browser so users don't lose their tasks on refresh.
