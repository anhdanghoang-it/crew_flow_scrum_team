A gamified habit tracking system that helps users build positive habits.

The system should allow users to create custom habits with names and daily targets.

Users can check-in daily for each habit by clicking a button.

The system calculates and displays streak counts (consecutive days completed).

Display a simple calendar heatmap showing check-ins over the last 30 days (green for completed, gray for missed).

Show basic statistics for each habit: current streak, longest streak, total check-ins.

The system awards simple badges: 🥉 Bronze (7 days), 🥈 Silver (30 days), 🥇 Gold (100 days).

Display an encouraging message when users complete a check-in or reach a milestone.

Users can view all their habits in a list with their current status.

The system should prevent duplicate check-ins on the same day for the same habit.

Include interactive real-time updates when users check-in (streak counter animates, heatmap updates immediately).

Show a simple progress chart/graph displaying completion rate over time.
